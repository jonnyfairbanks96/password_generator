# Password Generator

A CLI app to generate secure passwords.

## Basic Setup
To start creating secure passwords
1. Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/jonnyfairbanks96/password_generator.git`
2. Go into the directory `cd password_generator`
3. Change the permissions of the file by running `chmod +x ./generator.rb` so you can use `./generator.rb` to execute the app using `#!`
4. You should now be able to run the app by typing `./generator.rb` in your terminal!

Pro Tip:
Make an alias in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to run your app.
`alias newpassword ='~/path/to/generator.rb'` then run your alias anywhere in your terminal.
